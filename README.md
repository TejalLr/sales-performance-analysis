📊 Data Analysis with Python, SQL & Data Visualization
🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to extract insights from data using Python, SQL, and visualization techniques, following an end-to-end data analysis workflow. It reflects how I approach real-world data problems: from querying and cleaning data to analysis, visualization, and actionable insights.
The notebook is designed to be clear, reproducible, and business-oriented, making it easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand the results.


🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated
Python for Data Analysis: pandas, NumPy
SQL Integration: querying structured data efficiently
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Visualization: meaningful, insight-driven plots
Analytical Thinking & Problem Solving


🗂️ Project Structure
The notebook follows a structured and professional workflow:
Data Extraction (SQL)
Retrieve relevant data using SQL queries
Join and filter datasets to support analysis goals
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handle missing values and inconsistencies
Ensure data quality and reliability
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies
Use descriptive statistics to understand distributions
Data Visualization
Visualize key insights using clear and interpretable charts
Focus on storytelling, not just plotting
Insights & Conclusions
Translate findings into meaningful observations
Highlight implications for decision-making


📈 Why This Project Matters
This project showcases my ability to:
Work with realistic data pipelines (SQL → Python → Insights)
Write clean, readable, and well-commented code
Think beyond numbers and focus on business impact
Communicate insights clearly through visuals and explanations
It reflects the skills required for Data Analyst / Data Scientist / Analytics-focused roles, where turning raw data into actionable insights is critical.
